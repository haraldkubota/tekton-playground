# tekton-playground

This is mainly for using the LinuxAcademy/A Cloud Guru's playground.
Those are servers which you can use for learning. They are hosted on the
Internet and thus you can do things like exposing services to the Internet.
Note that only selected incoming ports are allowed.
See [here](https://support.linuxacademy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026494432-Open-Firewall-Rules-On-Servers-Cloud-Playground)
From 8000 to 8999 those are open for incoming traffic:
* 8000-8100
* 8140
* 8142
* 8443

## setup/

[Set up k3s and Tekton](https://github.com/haraldkubota/tekton-playground/tree/main/setup)
